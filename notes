Nexts.js is a framework built on top of React.
It gives the ability of building scalable apps by allowing you to render content on the server

Next.js is a fullstack framework!!
Next.js provides us with a node server out of the box.

With React you always render the content on the client side (there is no server)
With Next.js you can choose to that on the client side, on the server side or a mix of both.

Rendering techniques:

- Static Side Generation : for static content
- Server Side Rendering: if you want fresh content on page refresh => Each time you refresh the page, you render the content et refreshing the data again
- Incremental Site Regeneration: this is the best of both world.

Performance:

- Code Splitting (several bundles)
- Minifying Files (i.e. minifying the code)
- Image Optimization (render different file sizes based on the size of the viewport)
- Pre-fetching Assets

File Based Routing

- the api folder hosts all the backend logic (any route is the api folder is a server site route)

SEO

- Next.js give you the ability to add SEO easily to your site without adding any specific baggage.

Serveless Functions

- You can essentially run your Node.js code in the same code base as your React code, and it all lives inside the pages directly.
- Anything under the API folder also had a node server configured already
- It's called severless bc you only need the server to perform the specific task asked, and if there is no activity, the server is going to shutdown
